<div>
    <p>You've just created a Gilt Scala Library! Now lets explore the code and make some changes.</p>

    <h2>Project Structure</h2>

    <p>
    	There is one deployable artifact, the library  <a href="#code/src" class="shortcut">src</a>. 
    </p>

    <h2>Replacements</h2>

    <p>
        You'll need to update the following resources from the initial seed template
	<ul>
	    <li>User email address in config/external/gerrit/reviewers.yml</li>
	    <li>License, homepage, repository & developers information in build.sbt</li>
	    <li>User email address in .travis.yml</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Deploying to Maven Central</h2>
    <p>
        See: <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13.2/docs/Community/Using-Sonatype.html">SBT: Using Sonatype</a>

	The credentials for your Sonatype OSSRH account need to be added somewhere.
	Common convention is a ~/.sbt/0.13/sonatype.sbt file.
        
	In sbt, run publishSigned to publish your jar to Sonatype, afterwards you can
	run sonatypeRelease to perform the close and release steps in the Sonatype Nexus repository.

	<em>
	    Note: If your project version has a "SNAPSHOT" suffix, your project will be published to
	    the snapshot repository of Sonatype, and you cannot use the sonatypeRelease command.
        </em>
